        The other 3 tabs at the top will be for the other 3 forms of numbers that
        I want to display about the Bible. QUANTITIES, the number of times a word
        is used, and the number of times a word is used in a book. SEQUENCES, the
        number of times a number is used in a verse, and the number of times a number
        is used in a sequence in a book. PATTERNS, the number of times a number is
        used in a verse, chapter and book.
